INC3425192,Functionality,CompassOne,I-VANSH,"Hello
Can I have some help raising sub con extension on this deal please?

https://compassone.cloudapp.net/Deal/19996/Subcon/17416

I know the current workaround is to create customer WO amendment to extend that date out so can select further dates for sub con but one I am doing today does not seem to want to work.

I have changed the end date of the customer contract to 31st Dec 2016 in the customer deal ""contract"" tab

I have changed end date of sub con ""Contract"" tab to 11th Nov 2016

Sub con end date in financials wont' let me put a date past 31st August though (even though exiginst sug con contract is to end of Oct as per snip bellow)

I need the sub con end date to be 11th Nov 2016

I think I am missing a date update somewhere but cannot figure out where

Hoi Edith

België klopt.

Er staan er 3 op Carglass B.V.. Effective date december inderdaad maar een nieuwere versie van 29 maart 2016.
U0340254 en U2021072 staan beiden op adres: Science Park Eindhoven 5525 5692 EM Son. Van welke wil je een kopie?

Hi Marja

Ik krijg feedback van de klant dat deze MBSA de MBSA van Carglass België is. Zelf zeggen ze een andere MSBA getekend te hebben met een start datum van december 2015. Kun je dit nagaan alsjeblieft en mij voorzien van het nummer de effective date en het liefst ook een copy van de MBSA?

Als blijkt dat onderstaande MBSA die is voor NL dan willen ze graag een copy. Kun je mij die sturen?

Alvast dank!

Hi Dear

请帮忙查一下Cummins的Global MSA或MBSA的合同，多谢！
我们现在国内要签一个ESP，但对方法务对我们的MSA条款有分歧。
我咨询了我们的法务，如果我们能查到Global签过的MSA或MBSA的话，我们国内不用再签MSA了。

Could you please help with correct process?
We have prebilled MCS contract. And now customer need Premier hours but on contract is only consulting (that are billed through Premier).
How can we move consulting hours to Premier? Value of contract won't be changed at all.
Do we need to create Amendment or is there faster way?

Moi
tällä sopimuksella on ostettu konsultointia mutta nyt asiakas tarvitsisi osan tunneista premierin puolelle.
Kysyn sulta ensin että osaatko sanoa että miten tämän kanssa pitäisi edetä. Mahdollisimman yksinkertainen toteutus ;-)

Pitääkö tehdä ESWO amendment Compassin kautta vai riittääkö CR kun kokonaislaskutuksen määrä ei muutu.

I am trying to set the End Date for the Subcon resources to 30.11.2016. The Customer Contract has a flexible End Date (30.09.2016 or when the works are done in our case the works have to continue).
https://compassone.cloudapp.net/Deal/8188/Subcon/17748/resources

The WO for Roedl has End Date 30.11 plus the Financials and we need the same for Allgeier. Could you please fix it?
The matter is urgent since the Subcon has to work on Monday.

Thank you

INC3575091,Specific Error Message,Unicorn,JADONOV,"Hello

I cannot export software assurance information for (SPM=mbolton) or (SPM=dclarkeasinclcharbestholbro) I keep getting the attached error and then Unicorn closes itself.

To repro the issue generate a query where SPM=MBOLTON for SoftwareAssurance once query loads click into it and click the software assurance tab on the parent of all listed schedules and Unicorn fails.

This is impacting a regional SAB forecasting process where we identify lost revenue and bring it in before expiry.

I need to add customer name Metso Shared  Services Oy to CompassOne but Compass is unable to find it.
What should I do? This is correct customer name for invoicing and should be in ESWO. But if I put Metso Oyj to Compass and Metso Shared  Services Oy in ESWO it won't pass validation.

Thanks!

Since the Compass release of this weekend it is not possible to change the customer name field in Compass using the premier renewal function. This is a huge issue.

Examples:
Renewal customer CBS:  https://compassone.cloudapp.net/Deal/81490/Customer/91914/overview
Customer name in MSX ID 7-KDSYPOR3U is Ministerie van Economische Zaken opportunity description is Premier - Renewal FY17 CBS.
The name in Compass however shows as Tweede Kamer der Staten Generaal and not possible to change to CBS. As the company name in the contract is CBS it will not pass pre-validation because of the difference. Contract cannot be send to customer for signature.

MSX:

Once we receive the message that a deal has been fully executed the following message is showing:

""Next Steps: Please confirm all required information has been completed for your Agreement Setup Request(s) in CompassOne via the ""Your Tasks"" list. (1) Once confirmed you will need to submit the request(s) for Agreement Setup. (2) If you entered all required information prior to post-signature validation the deal has been automatically submitted for Agreement Setup.""

How would we know from that email if there are 1) open ""tasks"" in the list and we manually need to submit it for Agreement setup or if 2) all required fields are filled in and it was automatically submitted for Agreement Setup. It can't be that we need to open each deal in Compass in order to see if it has been sent automatically.

Thanks very much.

Is there an issue with saving flashes at the moment ?


I've updated one several times and gives the ""Flash updated successfully""

But I then go back into the flash and the changes are no longer there
This is happening to another user on a different machine also so this is not related to my machine or a specific flash it's the application and or database

Please log a job or advise the job number if its already been logged by someone else

Pretty much what the tile suggests.

Can create or edit a Flash and save it. Flash changes do not appear active afterwards.
Seems to revert back to the previous Flash even if you inactivate it or edit it.

Have confirmed team members and other people not in my team are encountering the same issue.

I can make myself available for a remote session to walk you through steps taken if this is needed.

Affecto ei nyt saa selville omasta organisaatiostaan kuka tuon uuden sopimuksen allekirjoittavat joten he tarvitsevat vähän lisäaikaa. Juttelin ohimennen Minnan kanssa että on mahdollista tehdä 30 päivän extended nykyiseen sopimukseen. Saatko semmoisen tehtyä ja mitä se käytännössä tarkoittaa asiakkaalle kustannusmielessä?

it needs to be moved back on Contract ID 0048617135; Schedule 805456549. if moving it back to the expired Schedule is not possible please provide an alternative/workaround. 
I opened an Axis Ticket and they recommended I contact your team:

Transport for NSW O365 Governance<https://compassone.cloudapp.net/Deal/18722/Customer/96162>

Thanks in advance.

one of your support people did speak to Steve Keen on skype on Weds evening sorry don't have the person's name but they were assisting us see a work package for a migrated from Compass/RPM deal.
The deal itself in CompassOne is : https://compassone.cloudapp.net/Deal/31405/Customer/35249
This was migrated over to shows as internal project but we now need to create new GRM against it and have been told these need to be under a Delivery project.  Steve Keen has been added as EM/TAM to the deal so should see a work package in GRM to create a Delivery project against but he does not.  Your support chap said he would investigate but not sure that has happened I also checked checked the end date on the work packages in CompassOne and they all show as the deals end date 28/02/2018 so that is not the issue I don't think.  We need to raise new GRMs urgently against this deal so please help. Thankyou",No,Closed,11-11-2016 13:21,,,,,

We need your help with this. 
 
Contract 0048638974
Schedule 805536525
 
For this schedule one line item (DSE-SCO) does not appear in the Schedule Overview in Unicorn although it is present under the Line Items Section. After discussions with the Unicorn Support Team we noticed that the correct component code for this should be SCO. But in Unicorn is SCY at the moment. The EOC team is unable to do anything as this field is not visible from their side.
 
Could you please change the code to SCO?

Thanks and regards

On which package. I'm adding Compass Help so that they can open a ticket and assist you quicker and for traceability. 

It looks like part of the issue is one or more of the packages no longer exists in its current format in the catalog and would need to be updated.

Hi Charlotte
 
I work with Kerry Lemiesz at the Service Center. We have an issue with Compass One where it won't let us make the changes it requires.
 
https://compassone.cloudapp.net/Deal/36609/Customer/89926/packages
 
 
We can't update the package because I'm 99% sure it's trying to delete the Term 2 line items which drops us below 0 for revenue because of the adjustment. But we can't take out the adjustment until we update the package so it's stuck where it's at.
 
Is there a way to make this update in CompassOne?
 
Thank you

See query remark below about the master agreement.
The Master agreement name in the ESWO template in CompassOne for a Microsoft Service Agreement does not pass pre-validation.
In Compass MS Business Agreement/Services is mentioned under Contract - Master Agreement. See screenshot. The name here should be adjusted to Microsoft Services Agreement (SA) as also mentioned in the ESWO template (Dutch and English) at K360 (attached). When we use these templates the name is accepted in pre-validation.
It must effect more countries than The Netherlands only. Thanks for your assistance to adjust the name in CompassOne.

Please your support on the following feedback form Swiss TAM (in cc)

Thomas opened an Axis Request for a Shared Source Request. The process worked fine including the booked hours in Chronos by the consultant. What Thomas observed - > the deduction of hours in the Premier contract is not real-time -> with a delay of one day. Do you know: Is this by design? I assume other TAMs will come up with the same experience / question.

I get errors trying to access this Project ID 5988 and that says 
""You don't have permission to access this project. Choose another or contact your administrator""

But I have permission to access all of Projects what RM(My administrator) created and other Project are no problem.
(e.g. Project ID 133166)
As far as has been hitherto observed this issue is suspected to be due to difference of Project Status/Sub Status.

Project ID 5988: Project Status/Sub Status - Draft
Project ID 133166: Project Status/Sub Status - Active/Ready

It seems to me that one Project must have at least one Role Submitted or Assigned to become status as Active.
I understand simple method is Add Role to Draft Project and to be change the Project Status from Draft to Active/Ready by RM.
But I would like to do same things in place of RM. 

What I really want to do is to be able to Add Role to Project ID which Project Status as Draft.

With this amendment we are adding hours hence the Subcon amount increases too so we DO need the amendment to got to EOC/ROC for prevalidation.

INC4269849,Functionality,CompassOne,I-VANSH,"Hello

I need to change some work package end dates on an existing deal and need your help please.

I need to raise GRM requests for people to end date of the deal but in original Compass deal when deal first created in 2013 we had to show end date as 28th Feb 2018.  This is because we had Premier roles as well as MCS on it and Premier work was starting a few months before MCS would in Compass we had to show it as a 54 month deal which Compass automatically worked out as ending 28th Feb 2018 but in reality (once MCS work started ) the end date is actually 31st May 2018.

The customer contract and CP set up all show end date as 31st May 2018 it was just in old Compass deal that end date was 28th Feb and there was no way of us changing that in the tool.

Now it as has pulled through to CompassOne it shows end date of 28th Feb 2018 and so work package end dates are 28th Feb 2018 in there and in GRM.

I need to change end dates in CompassOne to 31st May 2018 in order for me to have GRM end dates of 31st May 2018.

Do we do this via an amendment? If so I will want the deal in CompassOne to now show as in amendment going forward but need the end dates set to 31st May 2018 for current GRMs I need to raise and any future ones.

Hello Support


I was using custom views for some time without issue.
After a recent Unicorn update I noticed the half dozen or so custom views I use all reset to the same default view but kept the edited view name.
See screenshot below.




[cid:image003.jpg@01D24B02.28EACCE0]


I have gone and redited and saved these to how I would like them.
See screenshot below.

[cid:image004.jpg@01D24B02.28EACCE0]



Sadly these changes don't stick when saved. On reopening they are all back as per the first screenshot.
I have gone and recreated these several times. If someone can kindly get back to us on how to make these changes more permanent?

Can you please provide a link that will direct me to the location of all the CompassOne Training materials.
When I click on the link to the Compass Readiness Centre it opens a new window/tab which is blank - there is no information pulling through at all.
Has the location of the information been moved and the link not updated or is there a fault with this link? Compass Readiness Center<https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/compassready/>

Can this please be looked into as a matter of urgency as there is currently no guidance or directions on how to create a deal in CompassOne.
This will cause issues for all that need assistance with creating deal in CompassOne.

Many thanks

We don't get the following deals ESAP approved.
Subcon bill rates from the old Compass system haven't been migrated to CompassOne. So revenue and margin calculations are impacted !

INC4383959,Configuration,Axis,EGBARRON,"""Alternate Keyword:  Co-Sourcing "" 

I have the following concern.

There is a new co-sourcing process where in order to have a Consultant deliver a Premier service under a Premier contract the requestor has to follow a new process.
This new process states that: 
- TAM needs to create an Axis request 
- Resource Manager needs to identify a resource and assigned it through GRM 
- Consultant and Consultant Manager need to be onboard on Axis. 

From there a task should be created on Axis and on Chronos in order for the Consultant to enter his delivery time. 

my question is the following: 
- if after following all the previous steps the TASK still does not show up on either Axis or Chronos for the consultant to report his time what shall we do to escalate and get this resolved????

Many thanks for the help.

I managed to edit other entries which were individual but now the remaining ones are part of the ""information Distribution"" service and there is 1 entry that contains all schedules that were subscribed to that # for newsletters. besides this the  option to ""select contact"" is also missing
if you need more details feel free to contact me. 
here are the entries and the access ID that they need to be booked on. if you cannot book them on these specific accessIDs then please delete them and I will log new ones separately.

A fixed fee subcon WO needs to be updated to time and material. 
Can you provide any guidance here on how to resolve this as a best practice ?

Hi Marta

Remo wanted to discuss this in our weekly call. He is a bit more aware of the case than me.. 

I am sorry I do not have a better update at the moment.

Hi Ivelina

Please keep me posted how the subcon contract update from FF to TM goes for Inovativ. 
I hope all is good? Did you get support from CompassHelp? 

Thanks

HI Ivelina

I think I am aware of this case – we did some researches with RPT on that (attached).

My suggestion would be to amend the existing Subcon and fix the FF 'Fee arrangement' into the TM plus extend by hours you would like to add (highlighted in yellow below).
This of course needs to be completed in CompassOne and corrective Amendment signed by the Vendor.  

I am not sure how this technically works (I guess it should be easy) but if you have any 'Compass setup' questions I would suggest getting some help from Compass Help CompassHelp@microsoft.com team. 

 

Please keep me posted when this is done & ready to sign. This is so I can monitor with RPT that this is correctly fixed in CP setup too – the previous mismatch resulted in some confusion and data errors 

Good luck!

Thanks

Marta

Subject: CompassOne guidance requiered

Hi Marta

I was advised that you can help me with an issue we are facing.

So here is the situation. We have a contract in CompassOne (please see link: https://compassone.cloudapp.net/Deal/19827/Subcon/4896 ) that has been entered under 'Fixed Fee Contract'. It should have been entered as a 'Time and Material Contract'. Can that be fixed somehow?
Also Wouter needs an amendment to the 'Fixed Fee' contract however this cannot be done on a fixed fee contract so we decided to create a new WO for the same resource under the same deal & engagement this time with a 'Time and Material' contract please see link: https://compassone.cloudapp.net/Deal/19827/Subcon/19037 
This creates confusion in CompassOne. 

What would be a solution? I have not submitted the 'Time and Material WO' yet as I am not sure it is ok to continue? Can you please advise? 

Thank you very much in advance!

We are about to start an subcon amendment for following deal:
https://compassone.cloudapp.net/Deal/58137/Subcon/19101

(We are preparing it in advance so it will be easy when the customer deal is in place.)

When I entered the 40 new hours under Financials the bill rate for the first row was missing. I updated the bill rate to 2090 SEK but the Expected Revenue doesn't update as you can see below.
[cid:image003.jpg@01D25231.E6231660]
When I am in ""edit mode"" the revenue shows but as soon as I klick ""Save"" it falls back to Expected Revenue: 0 SEK.

We have seen before that the bill rate is missing on the first line when starting an amendment and therefore the Expected Revenue. Though we have been able to update it before. Can you please help us to solve this case?

Hi Frank

I just noticed that this AGD subcon amendment is still waiting for Martin's approval. I believe you need to request approval from the SI Domain plus need to complete a checklist (in attached email) in order for Carlos to provide the level 3 approval. Have I got that right Marty?

Because the SKU is not available I cannot move forward with this deal. It will not allow me to submit this for ESAP. This is an critical request.

I understand the Account Teams needs to negotiate this deal and making sure the contract goes thru the proper legal finance and business revision from the customer which takes time.

Please do not move forward with this deal until the correct year and SKU are available in Compass.    I understand that the account team and maybe the customer are anxious to get this deal done.  However the new program year they want to purchase does not start until 11 January 2017 which means waiting poses zero risk to the customer.  No workaround is required (nor approved by CSAOps).

We will let you know when we get confirmation that the additional program year has been added and you can then move forward with this deal.

Thank you for your patience.

Thank you for your response.

Unfortunately Year 1 has been removed from CompassOne. If we can get that reinstated we will move forward with the deal as you have laid out.

Hello

With the SKU not being available in the Phoenix catalog you can choose the current year sku in CompassOne.  You would need to add notes in agreement setup stating what the correct sku/year that is needed to entitle in clarify.  Just explaining that Year 2 is not available yet in the Phoenix catalog.

Thanks

Hi Brittany - The .Net 4.x Custom Support program was scheduled to end in January and the program/SKU was set up accordingly.

Engineering recently agreed to extend this program for a second year.  However since this extension was for this single customer we were waiting to extend the SKU until the account team confirmed that funding had been secured and that McDonalds planned to proceed with their purchase which just happened last week.

We have started the SKU request process but it will likely be a few weeks until the needed Year 2 SKU is active and available in Compass to add to this deal.  We will advise the account team when the SKU is available at which time the deal can be completed.

Thank you for your patience in this interim.

Regards

- Lisa

Hello Teams

We have a unique situation here.

McDonald's wants a Year 2 CSA for .Net Framework 4.0/4.5/4.51. This service was not extended past year 1 and their current CSA for this service will expire on 1/10/2017. There is an exception from Jack Ryder to extend this through Year 2.

With this we have a few questions. Please reply all and answer what you can. This request has CVP visibility attached is the email thread from Jack Ryder.

I'm not sure who can help us answer this question:
Is this possible? My understanding of the expiration of a CSA is that Microsoft will no longer be creating Security Updates of any kind for the technology once the CSA is expired. Is Microsoft going to continue to create and release security updates?

SBD:
We have Financial approval but I think we need SBD approval as well so it would be great if we could get this from SBD or an explanation as to why it is not approved through SBD.

Missie and Kim:
Missie and Kim we need to know if this is something the ROC can even do for us. Can you help us out on that front?

Compass Help:
In Compass we figured we would enter a Year 1 .Net Framework 4.0/4.5/4.51 and make sure the dates are for next year and make a note that it needs to be year 2. However when I select the .Net Framework 4.0/4.5/4.51 package there are no services found. This poses a concern for us because Year 1 ends in January. If we get a request for this service before the expiration we cannot create those either. My ask here is that Compass Help look into adding .Net Framework 4.0/4.5/4.51 services back into Compass One.

INC4517358,Specific Error Message,Unicorn,A-DEGENR,"Hi

Multiple users are reporting a large amount of errors in Unicorn mostly related to the inability to refresh queries. This seems to tie back to the inability to retrieve user details I suspect. 

I have tried clearing passwords but never get prompted for login upon launch. I have completely cleared the Data folder however the same still occurs upon re-launch (just in lesser numbers because there are no saved queries).

I have several questions and complains around compass tool.


  1.  What is the SLA for the deal to show as completed in the compass I have two deals that have been approved more than for 2 weeks already and they are still in agreement setup phase. How long this is going to be we need to close this as the engagements have been already delivered.

  1.  https://compassone.cloudapp.net/Deal/85853/Customer/97017
  2.  https://compassone.cloudapp.net/Deal/87659/Customer/99093

  1.  There is a deal that has already been approved later on the team found some issues and now for two month we are not able to push it forward customer is escalating and why does the customer has to suffer because of our internal procedures he has signed the contract already what is the problem. Everytime I sent for prevalidation the team is putting all the different reasons and not sending it forward. SE is also escalating for how long this is going to be why you cant fix this issue. Especially that this is an internal one. Compass team is putting everytime different reasons for review. Different person validation different reason to get the deal on hold. How long this is going to be and why the performance of the team is so poor. https://compassone.cloudapp.net/Deal/85848/Customer/97012
I am really very tired of all the internal administrative work around this deal as this is being done for no reason. We all work together and all this should not be an issue for the client.

Vedlagt finn du signert avtale og dei tre vedlegga som utgjer avtalegrunnlaget. Eg håpar alt er på plass og at me no kan ta jul med godt samvit. Ta kontakt med Thor-Inge viss det skulle vera noko.

We have a deal that has been progressed to the Agreement Set up stage in CompassOne but is unable to be completed due to an error where by the revenue for the Project manager is not calculating (showing as zero - see screenshot below).

[cid:image001.jpg@01D25D62.CC1AC3D0]

[cid:image002.jpg@01D25D62.CC1AC3D0]

This is resulting in the price to the customer showing as $72000 less than it should be. The payment milestones are adding up to the correct amount ($356520) however due to the price to customer being incorrect it is flagging as an issue:

Seeing as this is the end of the half year can you please help to resolve this issue with priority?

Many thanks

Hi Kenny

Can we sign a “framework work order” for rate card by using a work order and includes all the rates there? Since MSA is evergreen this kind of periodic documents should be signed at a work order level.

The rate card and discount scenarios need to be reviewed from business side. I’m not quite clear who is right person to approve rates and discounts so suggest you to check with BEO first on its approval process.

Helen

Dear Helen

We need to sign an amendment with L’Oreal to add our rate to the MSA so that we don’t need to bid for specific projects in the coming two years. Would you please check the attached MSA amendment and let me know if it’s ok from the legal side? I used the template previously signed with Roche Pharm.

Thank you.

Hello Charleen

Thank you for the response . I am writing you regarding point 4 for Amendment creation.
Following the One Note procedure  I couldn't get to Step 4: The Amendment will now show in the list of Active Deals as there was nothing to show except E-mail Contract:
[cid:image008.jpg@01D25B82.66E845A0]

Even trying on another Compass deal  I still couldn't get further than Step 3 :Click Contract Actions in the upper right screen.


Taking in consideration as of OneNote:""These types of requests will most likely be coordinated by the PjM.   "" I am wondering if we have full rights/access to Compass or am I doing something wrong ? Attaching the original request to the e-mail.



I would appreciate very much your advice.

Thank you

Hello guys!
How are you today?
Laura and I need your help withROSS2016093001244575!
We requested a swap for this ROSS to adjust the billing to Custom Proactive Onsite Operation 5 and we got it done in time. The contract expires tomorrow and even though the line item is available for use in Unicorn it doesn't seem to be available on Axis. Can you please help us understand why and how to fix it? The problem here is that after tomorrow we won't be able to change contract details and that's why our request is so urgent.
 
Here's a screenshot from Unicorn:

,,INC3425192,Oct,Sherlock,CompassOne,Functionality,Vanessa,Closed,"Hello
Can I have some help raising sub con extension on this deal please?

https://compassone.cloudapp.net/Deal/19996/Subcon/17416

I know the current workaround is to create customer WO amendment to extend that date out so can select further dates for sub con, but one I am doing today does not seem to want to work.

I have changed the end date of the customer contract to 31st Dec 2016 in the customer deal ""contract"" tab

I have changed end date of sub con ""Contract"" tab to 11th Nov 2016

Sub con end date in financials wont' let me put a date past 31st August though (even though exiginst sug con contract is to end of Oct as per snip bellow)

I need the sub con end date to be 11th Nov 2016

I think I am missing a date update somewhere but cannot figure out where

Hoi Edith,

België klopt.

Er staan er 3 op Carglass B.V.. Effective date december inderdaad, maar een nieuwere versie van 29 maart 2016.
U0340254 en U2021072 staan beiden op adres: Science Park Eindhoven 5525, 5692 EM Son. Van welke wil je een kopie?

Hi Marja,

Ik krijg feedback van de klant dat deze MBSA de MBSA van Carglass België is. Zelf zeggen ze een andere MSBA getekend te hebben met een start datum van december 2015. Kun je dit nagaan alsjeblieft en mij voorzien van het nummer, de effective date en het liefst ook een copy van de MBSA?

Als blijkt dat onderstaande MBSA die is voor NL, dan willen ze graag een copy. Kun je mij die sturen?

Alvast dank!

Hi Dear,

请帮忙查一下Cummins的Global MSA或MBSA的合同，多谢！
我们现在国内要签一个ESP，但对方法务对我们的MSA条款有分歧。
我咨询了我们的法务，如果我们能查到Global签过的MSA或MBSA的话，我们国内不用再签MSA了。

We have prebilled MCS contract. And now customer need Premier hours, but on contract is only consulting (that are billed through Premier).
How can we move consulting hours to Premier? Value of contract won't be changed at all.
Do we need to create Amendment or is there faster way?

Moi,
tällä sopimuksella on ostettu konsultointia, mutta nyt asiakas tarvitsisi osan tunneista premierin puolelle.
Kysyn sulta ensin, että osaatko sanoa, että miten tämän kanssa pitäisi edetä. Mahdollisimman yksinkertainen toteutus ;-)

Pitääkö tehdä ESWO amendment Compassin kautta vai riittääkö CR, kun kokonaislaskutuksen määrä ei muutu.

I am trying to set the End Date for the Subcon resources to 30.11.2016. The Customer Contract has a flexible End Date (30.09.2016 or when the works are done, in our case the works have to continue).
https://compassone.cloudapp.net/Deal/8188/Subcon/17748/resources

The WO for Roedl has End Date 30.11, plus the Financials and we need the same for Allgeier. Could you please fix it?
The matter is urgent, since the Subcon has to work on Monday.

I cannot export software assurance information for (SPM=mbolton) or (SPM=dclarke,asincl,charbe,stholbro), I keep getting the attached error and then Unicorn closes itself.

To repro the issue generate a query where SPM=MBOLTON for SoftwareAssurance, once query loads click into it and click the software assurance tab on the parent of all listed schedules and Unicorn fails.

This is impacting a regional SAB forecasting process where we identify lost revenue and bring it in before expiry.

The engagement manager for this program has been sent an email to say a new Campus site has been created for FF-BSKYB-UK57868-TenantMerge

The site is at https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/CampusProjectSites056_Ext/kssssdsvad

However, there is a site that has already been set up that we would prefer to use.  It's here:  https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/CampusProjectSites030_Ext/3hadshvhvh/

The EM has tried to add the CP code and MSX ID to the existing site but it says it's already in use elsewhere and has also tried to delete it from the new site and it says that's not permitted as it's the only CP code associated with that site.

Please could someone advise?  We need to use the existing site, it's already been shared widely.

Kind regards

Since the Compass release of this weekend, it is not possible to change the customer name field in Compass using the premier renewal function. This is a huge issue.

Examples:
Renewal customer CBS:  https://compassone.cloudapp.net/Deal/81490/Customer/91914/overview
Customer name in MSX ID 7-KDSYPOR3U is Ministerie van Economische Zaken, opportunity description is Premier - Renewal FY17 CBS.
The name in Compass however, shows as Tweede Kamer der Staten Generaal and not possible to change to CBS. As the company name in the contract is CBS it will not pass pre-validation because of the difference. Contract cannot be send to customer for signature.

MSX:
[cid:image013.png@01D22A2A.7DE66590]Compass:
[cid:image014.jpg@01D22A2C.77F617F0]

Customer name in MSX ID 7-L7LKQKKLD is Academisch Medisch Centrum, opportunity description is Premier - Renewal FY17.
The name in Compass however, shows as UMC St. Radboud and not possible to change to this name. Will not pass pre-validation, cannot be send for signature to customer.

Once we receive the message that a deal has been fully executed, the following message is showing:

""Next Steps: Please confirm all required information has been completed for your Agreement Setup Request(s) in CompassOne via the ""Your Tasks"" list. (1) Once confirmed you will need to submit the request(s) for Agreement Setup. (2) If you entered all required information prior to post-signature validation the deal has been automatically submitted for Agreement Setup.""

How would we know from that email if there are 1) open ""tasks"" in the list and we manually need to submit it for Agreement setup, or if 2) all required fields are filled in and it was automatically submitted for Agreement Setup. It can't be that we need to open each deal in Compass in order to see if it has been sent automatically.

Thanks very much.

I'm contacting you regarding the below amendment :
https://compassone.cloudapp.net/Deal/30474/Customer/92525/packages

AS I can't change the package initiated from the renew (BANQUE DE FRANCE-PSfE Tailored-2016-17) that I've tried to amend, I can't as well start to proceed with the prevalidation of the deal.
Would you be able to help and support on this issue?

Thank you in advance for your feedback.

Need your kindly support with one of my query in Compass Deal for India:

Query is:

  *   Reason
1. Price to customer total - Thanks for making changes. We regret to inform you that we are unable to proceed as the changed made affected the ""price to customer total"" under financial / summary tab. Please ensure that the price to customer total also computes 0.00 instead of 0.01.

Can you please help to resolve below query?

Pretty much what the tile suggests.

Can create or edit a Flash and save it. Flash changes do not appear active afterwards.
Seems to revert back to the previous Flash even if you inactivate it or edit it.

Have confirmed team members and other people not in my team are encountering the same issue.

I can make myself available for a remote session to walk you through steps taken if this is needed.

Hello this may be a CompassOne issue not GRM or both.
one of your support people did speak to Steve Keen on skype on Weds evening, sorry don't have the person's name but they were assisting us see a work package for a migrated from Compass/RPM deal.
The deal itself in CompassOne is : https://compassone.cloudapp.net/Deal/31405/Customer/35249
This was migrated over to shows as internal project but we now need to create new GRM against it and have been told these need to be under a Delivery project.  Steve Keen has been added as EM/TAM to the deal so should see a work package in GRM to create a Delivery project against but he does not.  Your support chap said he would investigate but not sure that has happened, I also checked checked the end date on the work packages in CompassOne and they all show as the deals end date 28/02/2018 so that is not the issue I don't think.

Hi Charlotte,
 
I work with Kerry Lemiesz at the Service Center. We have an issue with Compass One where it won't let us make the changes it requires.
 
https://compassone.cloudapp.net/Deal/36609/Customer/89926/packages
 
 
We can't update the package because I'm 99% sure it's trying to delete the Term 2 line items, which drops us below 0 for revenue because of the adjustment. But we can't take out the adjustment until we update the package, so it's stuck where it's at.
 
Is there a way to make this update in CompassOne?

See query remark below about the master agreement.
The Master agreement name in the ESWO template in CompassOne for a Microsoft Service Agreement does not pass pre-validation.
In Compass, MS Business Agreement/Services is mentioned under Contract - Master Agreement. See screenshot. The name here should be adjusted to Microsoft Services Agreement (SA) as also mentioned in the ESWO template (Dutch and English) at K360 (attached). When we use these templates, the name is accepted in pre-validation.
It must effect more countries than The Netherlands only. Thanks for your assistance to adjust the name in CompassOne.

,,INC4158904,Nov,Michishita,Global Resource Management,Specific Error Message,Miwa,Resolved,"""Alternate Keyword:  Project Status/Sub Status - Draft"" 

I get errors trying to access this Project ID 5988, and that says 
""You don't have permission to access this project. Choose another or contact your administrator""

But I have permission to access all of Projects what RM(My administrator) created and other Project are no problem.
(e.g. Project ID 133166)
As far as has been hitherto observed this issue is suspected to be due to difference of Project Status/Sub Status.

Project ID 5988: Project Status/Sub Status - Draft
Project ID 133166: Project Status/Sub Status - Active/Ready

It seems to me that one Project must have at least one Role Submitted or Assigned to become status as Active.
I understand simple method is Add Role to Draft Project and to be change the Project Status from Draft to Active/Ready by RM.
But I would like to do same things in place of RM. 

What I really want to do is to be able to Add Role to Project ID which Project Status as Draft.
Could you tell me how to do this?",A-MIMIC,11/22/2016 4:38,Yes

With a huge volume of subcontractors in the Netherlands I'm wondering if the delta between report- and data mart refresh is normal?


?  In the screenshot the delta seems about 4 days ...

?  In the processing of subconWO and AMD's a daily refresh would be more helpful;


Further improvements for the report (screenshot 02)

I have a problem with that deal and need your involvement please – this deal was from FY16 and it took long to sign the contract with the customer. Finally the team was able to get the signature on the contract but the deal approached 90 days from approval. I reset the approval but it is appeared that since the package cost changed (it was $16,800, now it is $14000), the contract has been signed with the price $16800 and the engagement has been delivered.
 
So the old package has been updated in the Financial part, but I cannot add the one that costs $14000 as it was communicated to the customer that it was $16,800.

With this amendment we are adding hours hence the Subcon amount increases too, so we DO need the amendment to got to EOC/ROC for prevalidation.

Can you help in understanding what is happening to this deal?

,,INC4218260,Nov,Dillon,CompassOne,Specific Error Message,Silvia,Closed,"Hi

This deal [link<https://compassone.cloudapp.net/Deal/19850/Subcon/17937>] has been approved today and if one goes into the approval page it shows as approved, however at the top line the ""approve"" arrow is still orange and I can't submit the amendment (that is uploaded in the documents) to ROC as it shows as Reviews not required.

With this amendment we are adding hours hence the Subcon amount increases too, so we DO need the amendment to got to EOC/ROC for prevalidation.

Can you help in understanding what is happening to this deal?

Subject: Payment term reduction
Importance: High

Hi Marlena,

Our customer Statens Vegvesen has asked us to set payment term to 15 days (from 30 days).
The start date on the contract is 5th December 2016.

Do I need to request a CTE approval?

Many thanks in advance,
Rosita

I need to change some work package end dates on an existing deal and need your help please.

I need to raise GRM requests for people to end date of the deal, but in original Compass deal when deal first created in 2013 we had to show end date as 28th Feb 2018.  This is because we had Premier roles as well as MCS on it and Premier work was starting a few months before MCS would, in Compass we had to show it as a 54 month deal which Compass automatically worked out as ending 28th Feb 2018, but in reality (once MCS work started ) the end date is actually 31st May 2018.

The customer contract and CP set up all show end date as 31st May 2018 it was just in old Compass deal that end date was 28th Feb and there was no way of us changing that in the tool.

Now it as has pulled through to CompassOne, it shows end date of 28th Feb 2018 and so work package end dates are 28th Feb 2018 in there and in GRM.

I need to change end dates in CompassOne to 31st May 2018 in order for me to have GRM end dates of 31st May 2018.

Do we do this via an amendment? If so, I will want the deal in CompassOne to now show as in amendment going forward but need the end dates set to 31st May 2018 for current GRMs I need to raise and any future ones.

Hello Support,


I was using custom views for some time without issue.
After a recent Unicorn update I noticed the half dozen or so custom views I use all reset to the same default view but kept the edited view name.
See screenshot below.




[cid:image003.jpg@01D24B02.28EACCE0]


I have gone and redited and saved these to how I would like them.
See screenshot below.

Sadly these changes don't stick when saved. On reopening they are all back as per the first screenshot.
I have gone and recreated these several times. If someone can kindly get back to us on how to make these changes more permanent?

,,INC4383959,Dec,Guzman Barron,Axis,Configuration,Enrique,Closed,"""Alternate Keyword:  Co-Sourcing "" 

I have the following concern.

There is a new co-sourcing process where in order to have a Consultant deliver a Premier service under a Premier contract the requestor has to follow a new process.
This new process states that: 
- TAM needs to create an Axis request 
- Resource Manager needs to identify a resource and assigned it through GRM 
- Consultant and Consultant Manager need to be onboard on Axis. 

From there a task should be created on Axis and on Chronos in order for the Consultant to enter his delivery time. 

my question is the following: 
- if after following all the previous steps the TASK still does not show up on either Axis or Chronos for the consultant to report his time, what shall we do to escalate and get this resolved????

Many thanks for the help.

Subject: RE: CompassOne guidance requiered

HI Ivelina,

I think I am aware of this case – we did some researches with RPT on that (attached).

My suggestion would be to amend the existing Subcon and fix the FF 'Fee arrangement' into the TM plus extend by hours you would like to add (highlighted in yellow below).
This of course needs to be completed in CompassOne and corrective Amendment signed by the Vendor.  

I am not sure how this technically works (I guess it should be easy) but if you have any 'Compass setup' questions, I would suggest getting some help from Compass Help CompassHelp@microsoft.com team. 

 

Please keep me posted when this is done & ready to sign. This is so I can monitor with RPT that this is correctly fixed in CP setup too – the previous mismatch resulted in some confusion and data errors 

Good luck!

Thanks,

Marta

Hi Marta,

I was advised that you can help me with an issue we are facing.

So, here is the situation. We have a contract in CompassOne (please see link: https://compassone.cloudapp.net/Deal/19827/Subcon/4896 ), that has been entered under 'Fixed Fee Contract'. It should have been entered as a 'Time and Material Contract'. Can that be fixed somehow?
Also, Wouter needs an amendment to the 'Fixed Fee' contract, however this cannot be done on a fixed fee contract, so we decided to create a new WO for the same resource under the same deal & engagement, this time with a 'Time and Material' contract, please see link: https://compassone.cloudapp.net/Deal/19827/Subcon/19037 
This creates confusion in CompassOne. 

What would be a solution? I have not submitted the 'Time and Material WO' yet, as I am not sure it is ok to continue? Can you please advise? 

Thank you very much in advance!

,,INC4428152,Dec,Larrauri Palma,Unicorn,Data Missing/Incomplete/Inaccurate,Andrea,Closed,"Specifically  for INDIA country TAG when exporting bulk email, the tool exports for the TAG _SC-Weekly 392 mlx instead of 391 and for TAG _SC-CT the tool exports 351 instead of 350. 
It means Unicorn is exporting twice the same MLXs, we managed to find out which schedule ID was and found that IN-Adani Enterprises Limited-Lift and Shift was being double exported. 

Please find attached mlxs for reference.

Could you please refer to Francisco Buendia (a-frbuen) and myself to see why is this occurring?

We are about to start an subcon amendment for following deal:
https://compassone.cloudapp.net/Deal/58137/Subcon/19101

(We are preparing it in advance so it will be easy when the customer deal is in place.)

When I entered the 40 new hours under Financials the bill rate for the first row was missing. I updated the bill rate to 2090 SEK but the Expected Revenue doesn't update as you can see below.
[cid:image003.jpg@01D25231.E6231660]
When I am in ""edit mode"" the revenue shows, but as soon as I klick ""Save"" it falls back to Expected Revenue: 0 SEK.

We have seen before that the bill rate is missing on the first line when starting an amendment and therefore the Expected Revenue. Though, we have been able to update it before. Can you please help us to solve this case?

Hi Frank,

I just noticed that this AGD subcon amendment is still waiting for Martin's approval. I believe you need to request approval from the SI Domain plus need to complete a checklist (in attached email) in order for Carlos to provide the level 3 approval. Have I got that right Marty?

Please do not move forward with this deal until the correct year and SKU are available in Compass.    I understand that the account team and maybe the customer are anxious to get this deal done.  However, the new program year they want to purchase does not start until 11 January 2017 which means waiting poses zero risk to the customer.  No workaround is required (nor approved by CSAOps).

We will let you know when we get confirmation that the additional program year has been added and you can then move forward with this deal.

Thank you for your patience.

Unfortunately, Year 1 has been removed from CompassOne. If we can get that reinstated, we will move forward with the deal as you have laid out.

Hello,

With the SKU not being available in the Phoenix catalog, you can choose the current year sku in CompassOne.  You would need to add notes in agreement setup stating what the correct sku/year that is needed to entitle in clarify.  Just explaining that Year 2 is not available yet in the Phoenix catalog.

Hi Brittany - The .Net 4.x Custom Support program was scheduled to end in January and the program/SKU was set up accordingly.

Engineering recently agreed to extend this program for a second year.  However, since this extension was for this single customer, we were waiting to extend the SKU until the account team confirmed that funding had been secured and that McDonalds planned to proceed with their purchase, which just happened last week.

We have started the SKU request process but it will likely be a few weeks until the needed Year 2 SKU is active and available in Compass to add to this deal.  We will advise the account team when the SKU is available at which time the deal can be completed.

Thank you for your patience in this interim.

Regards,

- Lisa

Importance: High

Hello Teams,

We have a unique situation here.

McDonald's wants a Year 2 CSA for .Net Framework 4.0/4.5/4.51. This service was not extended past year 1 and their current CSA for this service will expire on 1/10/2017. There is an exception from Jack Ryder to extend this through Year 2.

With this, we have a few questions. Please reply all and answer what you can. This request has CVP visibility, attached is the email thread from Jack Ryder.

I'm not sure who can help us answer this question:
Is this possible? My understanding of the expiration of a CSA is that Microsoft will no longer be creating Security Updates of any kind for the technology once the CSA is expired. Is Microsoft going to continue to create and release security updates?

SBD:
We have Financial approval, but I think we need SBD approval as well, so it would be great if we could get this from SBD or an explanation as to why it is not approved through SBD.

Missie and Kim:
Missie and Kim, we need to know if this is something the ROC can even do for us. Can you help us out on that front?

Compass Help:
In Compass, we figured we would enter a Year 1 .Net Framework 4.0/4.5/4.51 and make sure the dates are for next year and make a note that it needs to be year 2. However, when I select the .Net Framework 4.0/4.5/4.51 package, there are no services found. This poses a concern for us because Year 1 ends in January. If we get a request for this service before the expiration, we cannot create those either. My ask here is that Compass Help look into adding .Net Framework 4.0/4.5/4.51 services back into Compass One.

I have several questions and complains around compass tool.


  1.  What is the SLA for the deal to show as completed in the compass I have two deals that have been approved more than for 2 weeks already and they are still in agreement setup phase. How long this is going to be we need to close this as the engagements have been already delivered.

  1.  https://compassone.cloudapp.net/Deal/85853/Customer/97017
  2.  https://compassone.cloudapp.net/Deal/87659/Customer/99093

  1.  There is a deal that has already been approved later on the team found some issues and now for two month we are not able to push it forward customer is escalating and why does the customer has to suffer because of our internal procedures he has signed the contract already what is the problem. Everytime I sent for prevalidation the team is putting all the different reasons and not sending it forward. SE is also escalating for how long this is going to be, why you cant fix this issue. Especially that this is an internal one. Compass team is putting everytime different reasons for review. Different person validation different reason to get the deal on hold. How long this is going to be and why the performance of the team is so poor. https://compassone.cloudapp.net/Deal/85848/Customer/97012
I am really very tired of all the internal administrative work around this deal as this is being done for no reason. We all work together and all this should not be an issue for the client.

Viser til tidlegare korrespondanse med Thor-Inge Næsset og vår telefonsamtale i går der det vart stadfesta punkt 2 bokstav d siste setning i Business and Service Agreement ikkje er til hinder for at NHH kan halda fram med å bistå dei to andre føretaka i NHH-klynga, SNF og AFF.

Vedlagt finn du signert avtale og dei tre vedlegga som utgjer avtalegrunnlaget. Eg håpar alt er på plass og at me no kan ta jul med godt samvit. Ta kontakt med Thor-Inge viss det skulle vera noko.

We have a deal that has been progressed to the Agreement Set up stage in CompassOne but is unable to be completed due to an error where by the revenue for the Project manager is not calculating (showing as zero - see screenshot below).

This is resulting in the price to the customer showing as $72,000 less than it should be. The payment milestones are adding up to the correct amount ($356,520), however due to the price to customer being incorrect, it is flagging as an issue:

Seeing as this is the end of the half year, can you please help to resolve this issue with priority?

Hi Kenny,

Can we sign a “framework work order” for rate card by using a work order and includes all the rates there? Since MSA is evergreen, this kind of periodic documents should be signed at a work order level.

The rate card and discount scenarios need to be reviewed from business side. I’m not quite clear who is right person to approve rates and discounts, so suggest you to check with BEO first on its approval process.

Regards,
Helen

Dear Helen,

We need to sign an amendment with L’Oreal to add our rate to the MSA, so that we don’t need to bid for specific projects in the coming two years. Would you please check the attached MSA amendment and let me know if it’s ok from the legal side? I used the template previously signed with Roche Pharm.

Thank you.

Hello Charleen,

Thank you for the response . I am writing you regarding point 4 for Amendment creation.
Following the One Note procedure , I couldn't get to Step 4: The Amendment will now show in the list of Active Deals as there was nothing to show except E-mail Contract:
[cid:image008.jpg@01D25B82.66E845A0]

Even trying on another Compass deal , I still couldn't get further than Step 3 :Click Contract Actions in the upper right screen.


Taking in consideration as of OneNote:""These types of requests will most likely be coordinated by the PjM.   "", I am wondering if we have full rights/access to Compass or am I doing something wrong ? Attaching the original request to the e-mail.



I would appreciate very much your advice.

Thank you,

Tatiana

Yes, but it is available on Unicorn, which makes me think that it might be a problem with the communication between Unicorn and Axis, maybe? I don't know!

Hello, guys!
How are you today?
Laura and I need your help withROSS2016093001244575!
We requested a swap for this ROSS to adjust the billing to Custom Proactive Onsite Operation 5 and we got it done in time. The contract expires tomorrow and even though the line item is available for use in Unicorn, it doesn't seem to be available on Axis. Can you please help us understand why and how to fix it? The problem here is that after tomorrow, we won't be able to change contract details and that's why our request is so urgent.
 
Here's a screenshot from Unicorn:
 
 
Here's a screenshot from Axis:
 
 
Please, let me know if there's anything I can do!
Thanks a bunch
Have a fantastic 2017!

